# password-generator

## Description

The goal of this project was to display a password that has the correct amount and type of characters that the user selected. I took on this task in order to better understand how to solve a problem using JavaScript. While working on this project, I familiarized myself with psuedocoding which helped break down a complex problem into smaller pieces. I also became more comfortable using if statements and array methods. Although I was unable to make the password generator adjust given the amount of characters the user selected, I was still able to learn a lot.

## Usage

To use the password generator, click the "Generate Password" button in the deployed live application. Users can input how many characters they would like their password to contain. If the length is less than 8 characters or more than 128 characters, another prompt will display telling the user to please select a number between this range. Next, the user will be asked to confirm whether or not they would like special, numeric, lowercase and/or uppercase characters. Once the user is done answering these questions, their password will be displayed in the box.
