Building a Password Generator 
(RANDOM)

VARIABLES - passwordLength, for the confirms 

prompt the user for how many chars they would like in their password 

CONFIRMS STORE BOOLEAN VALUES 
confirm to ask user if they would like special chars 
confirm to ask user if they would like numeric chars 
confirm to ask user if they would like lowercase chars 
confirm to ask user if they would like uppercase chars 

HOW AM I GOING TO BUILD THIS???

we are going to need to use Math.floor(), Math.random()

var specialChars = ["+", "$", "~"];
using 3 values for now, can add more later 
var numericChars = ["1", "2", "3"];
